# Simple Sudoku Solvers
Copyright (c) 2018 Bart Massey

This repo contains simplified and slow Python solvers for Sudoku
puzzles. There is a complete-search solver and a
local-search solver. The latter is still work-in-progress
and is too slow to solve hard puzzles.

The backtracking implementation follows the framework from
Steven Skiena's *The Algorithm Design Handbook,* second
edition.
